# ragtrain

*ragtrain* is a not-quite-acronym for **retrieval-augmented train of thought**!

## Why another note-taking tool?

The goal of *ragtrain* is to make it as easy as possible to capture anything which comes to mind, and to quickly find it later.

There is a place and time for the structured and categorised, the tags and the folders, the refactoring and the editing. Most note-taking tools are designed for this very purpose! *ragtrain* is not.

Rather, it is for the raw and unvarnished thoughts that come to you in the shower, or while you're out for a walk. It is for the thoughts that you don't want to lose, but aren't worth organising in the moment. 

## What is the philosophy behind *ragtrain*?

Two key principles:

- Speed is a quality in its own right! Every friction point is an opportunity to lose a thought.
- Retrieval and generation are two sides of the same coin! No thought starts on a blank page, and the job of a note-taking tool is to help you follow your own train of thought.

To these ends, *ragtrain* consists of two parts: an append-only log of thoughts, and a semantic search engine to find them later. The punchline is that in the vein of [notational velocity](https://notational.net/), both searching and appending start from the same place, and they occur keystroke-by-keystroke!
